                <p>This session is dedicated to focused, independent group work. Your mission is to follow the Lab
                    Manual workflow below to translate your abstract concepts into a concrete, measurable research
                    design. This will complete your <strong>Project Foundation Document.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>This is a self-guided session.</strong> I am available for support via email, so please don't
                    hesitate to reach out if you get stuck!</p>

                        <p><strong>Problem: "I can't find ANY literature on my topic!"</strong><br>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> Your topic is likely too specific. Broaden your keywords. Instead
                            of "host authenticity in German true-crime podcasts," search for "source credibility in
                            podcasts" or "parasocial relationships and trust."
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Problem: "I found TOO MUCH literature!"</strong><br>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> Your topic is too broad. Narrow your scope. Add limiting keywords
                            like a specific country ("Germany"), a specific platform ("TikTok"), a specific genre ("news
                            podcasts"), or a specific demographic ("young adults").
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Problem: "My variables are qualitative (e.g., 'community feeling'). How do I
                                operationalize them?"</strong><br>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> This is where theory and previous literature are essential. Look
                            at how seminal papers on your concept <strong>defined</strong> and <strong>measured</strong>
                            it. Did they measure
                            'community' as the frequency of user comments, the use of inclusive language ("we," "our
                            community"), or through survey items asking about a 'sense of belonging'? Your job is to
                            adopt or adapt their established measurement strategy.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Problem: "How do I properly cite a scale I found in another paper?"</strong><br>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> You must always cite the <strong>original source</strong> that
                            developed and validated the scale, not just the recent paper where you found it. This shows
                            you've done your due diligence. For example: 'To measure parasocial interaction, we used the
                            10-item scale originally developed by <code>Rubin, Perse, and Powell (1985)</code>.'

                        <h4>Example for "State of Research & Research Gap" Section</h4>
                        <blockquote>
                            Previous research has firmly established that parasocial relationships (PSR) are a key
                            driver of listener loyalty and engagement in broadcast media (<code>Author, 2022</code>).
                            Studies have often measured PSR using the scale developed by
                            <code>Rubin et al. (1985)</code> and have typically focused on television personalities or
                            major influencers (<code>Author, 2021</code>). However, the role of host self-disclosure in
                            fostering these relationships within the specific, intimate context of niche educational
                            podcasts remains underexplored. While the effects of PSR are known, the mechanisms that
                            build it in audio-only environments are less understood. Therefore, our project addresses
                            this research gap by investigating how different levels of host vulnerability impact the
                            formation of PSR among listeners of educational podcasts.

                        <h4>Example for "Methodology Plan" Section</h4>
                        <blockquote>
                            The independent variable, <strong>host self-disclosure</strong>, will be operationalized as
                            the presence or absence of a personal anecdote within the podcast introduction. The
                            dependent variable, <strong>parasocial relationship</strong>, will be measured using the
                            10-item Parasocial Interaction Scale (<code>Rubin et al., 1985</code>) on a 5-point Likert
                            scale.<br><br>
                            Our study will target German-speaking adults who listen to educational podcasts at least
                            once a week. We will employ a <strong>purposive sampling</strong> strategy, recruiting
                            participants from online forums and social media groups dedicated to popular science
                            podcasts. Based on conventions for a two-group comparison (t-test) with an expected medium
                            effect size, we will aim for a minimum sample size of <strong>128 participants</strong> (64
                            per condition).
